We maintain a list of banned and unadvised third-party JavaScript libraries; these libraries are not allowed/recommended in add-ons.

## Banned libraries

We allow the latest 1.x version at submission time; previous versions are not accepted due to security vulnerabilities.

### jQuery < 3.0

jQuery versions older than 3.0 are no longer allowed in extensions. These versions are not supported by the jQuery team and may contain security vulnerabilities.

## DOMPurify
