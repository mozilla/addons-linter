# Add-on Type Support [DRAFT]

Going forward the amo-validator will continue to be the linter for legacy addo-ns. This document lists what types of addons the addon-linter will support and provides somde details as to the scope of the features needed.

- Web Extensions
- Dictionaries
- Language Packs
- Search Add-ons

## Web Extensions

Required features for linting:

- Validation of the `manifest.json`. Swtich to JSON scheme for this.
- Look into rules for to guard against inadvertent privilege escalation holes. This type of issue would come from a site exploiting an extension.
- js validation of content scripts (Rules need TBD)
- Flag un-approved libs based on file name that match libs
- Skip JS linting on libs that match the approved list.
- Rules for specific APIs.

Nice to haves:

- Deal with aiding ports from Google Chrome + Opera.
- Determine if an API being used is missing a permission
- Determine if a Permission is begin asked for unnecessarily.

## Dictionaries

- Deal with any dictionary specific rules.

Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Creating_a_spell_check_dictionary_add-on

## Lang Packs

- Validate `chrome.manifest`
- Deal with any other langpack specific rules.

Docs appear to be a bit thin on the ground for these. They need looking into further and we should look at the existing rules.

## Search Addons

What's needed?
